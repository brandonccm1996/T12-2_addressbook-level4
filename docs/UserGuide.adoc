== Introduction

Health Book is an address book application that is *catered for healthcare professionals who seek to retrieve their patients’ personal information and health-related information* all in one place. *Command Line Interface is utilized mainly for the input*, while GUI is used mainly to display the output. By combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI.

== Quick Start (to be edited in the future)

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `healthbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Health Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Health Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/asthma`, `t/diabetes t/stroke` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

*Application Workflow*

   c. Height
   d. Weight
   e. Gender
   f. Occupation.
   g. Marital Status
