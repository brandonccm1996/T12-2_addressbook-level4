== PROJECT: HealthBook

---

== Overview

HealthBook is an address book application that is catered for healthcare professionals who seek to retrieve their patientsâ€™ personal information and health-related information all in one place. Command Line Interface is utilized mainly for the input, while GUI is used mainly to display the output. By combining these 2 interfaces, Health Book aims to provide healthcare professionals with the speed and efficiency obtained from a CLI while retaining the systematic view of information through the GUI.
