== PROJECT: Health Book

---

== Overview

Health Book is a application written in Java. Its main purpose is to help healthcare professionals retrieve their patients’ personal and health-related information more efficiently. The user uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) to input commands and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to display the patients’ information. My team consisted of a Project Manager, a Development Lead, a Design Lead, a Subject Matter Expert and myself, the Quality Assurance Lead. All of us contributed features to our application and my job was to ensure that our application runs smoothly.
